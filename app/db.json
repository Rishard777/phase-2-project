      "description": "Eero Aarnio's Ball Chair became an icon of pop design, with its distinctly unnatural space-capsule-like character, strict geometry, and synthetic materials and colours all pointing to a man-made future. Designers had experimented with one-piece chair seats and backs since the 1950s, but Aarnio's design was the first to offer an all-encompassing micro-environment which isolated the sitter. Aarnio even installed telephones in some Ball Chairs, acknowledging that they were like small private rooms.",

'I had the idea of a transparent ball, where light comes from all directions. Acrylic can be heated and blown into shape like a soap bubble, and I knew that dome-shaped skylights were made that way. I contacted a manufacturer and asked if it would be technically possible to blow a bubble big enough for my chair. They said yes.'",
